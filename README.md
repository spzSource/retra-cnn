# retra-cnn
The NN-like system which succesfully solves classification task. Classification performance and quality was tested using 
CIFAR-10 image database, which contains 100 thousand of images devided by 10 classes.

## Major results:
- ability to automate NN-models creation using genetic algorithm for automation;
- classification quality is in range between 73 - 75 %;
- model capable to solve localization task using a CAM-model (class activation maps model). Quality is about 50%.

## Live result:

Classification and localization in the same model:
